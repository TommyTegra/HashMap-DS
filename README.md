# HashMap-DS
HashMap Data Structure Implementation (Python): Methods and functions implementation to achieve a working implementation of a HashMap that utilizes chaining for collision resolution and another HashMap implementation that utilizes open addressing via quadratic probing as a collision resolution.

Both hashmap files relies on a6_include.py which contains implementations of two different data structures: Dynamic Array and Linked List. It also contains a HashEntry class to be used in open addressing hashmap.

The file hash_map_sc.py utilizes chaining with quadratic probing while the file hash_map_oa.py utilizes open addressing for collision resolution. Both files contains testcases to test the implementation of the methods and functions within.
